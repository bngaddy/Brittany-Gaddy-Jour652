              <p>Death, war, divorce: None of these seem like auspicious subjects for a children’s television program. But for more than 30 years, beginning in 1968 on National Educational Television (the precursor to PBS), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/magazine/mr-rogers.html" target="_blank"> Fred Rogers </a> covered all of these topics and more, with empathy and honesty. The soft-spoken, cardigan-wearing, former Presbyterian minister was concerned with not just the academic but the emotional education of children. As he told members of the Senate who were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMdTl2R354A" target="_blank">debating whether to defund public television</a> in 1969, “I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service.” With the help of Daniel Tiger, King Friday XIII, Officer Clemmons and the rest of the residents of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQS3JGqx46U" target="_blank"> his neighborhood</a>, Mr. Rogers taught viewers of all ages to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viqPDiH7M9A" target="_blank"> not be afraid of their feelings</a>, to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mister-rogers-look-for-the-helpers-quote_n_5b19477ce4b0599bc6e15b4e" target="_blank">always look for the helpers </a>and to

              <p>The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/arts/television/hbos-cinema-verite-looks-at-american-family.html" target="_blank">called it</a> “dissolution of TV in life, dissolution of life in TV”: “An American Family,” the 1973 documentary series revealing seven months in the home of Santa Barbara’s Loud family, presaged the coming of reality television by many years. In retrospect, the series is an appealingly loose portrait of mundane family life, captured before the tropes of reality TV calcified and the banal was repackaged as slickly sensational. But at the time it was controversial, dismissed by some as voyeuristic, fake-seeming or unfairly edited. The series represented a disruption both for television and the American family’s self-image: It chronicled Bill and Pat Loud’s divorce, and followed their eldest son, Lance, as he moved to New York and came out as gay. Lance became perhaps the first reality star, emerging from the show as a gay icon and epitomizing, as he put it himself, “the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are.” </p>

              <p> While now entrenched in the comedy pantheon, “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” was relatively unknown in America when it finished its run in England in 1974. Few, including its six members, thought its humor would translate. It was too highbrow, too weird, too British. That this was proved wrong by PBS, which is not known for anarchic humor, is an absurdity worthy of Python. Classic sketches about the
                <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2hwqki" target="_blank">Ministry of Silly Walks</a>, dead parrots or the military’s weaponization of a joke so funny people die laughing became instant hits among public television audiences. When ABC aired edited episodes of the show, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/03/29/naughty-bits" target="_blank">Monty Python sued</a>, becoming the rare comedians to actually fight to stay off network television.</p>

              <p>When I was a kid my mom and I would watch PBS together, and Julia Child was just the most fascinating figure to me because she took herself — not seriously! At all. I just remember how funny and real she was — hitting the garlic and it would kick across the room and she’d just keep going, and she’d throw in fistfuls of salt, and she’d drink. My mom worked in restaurants for 60 years and I always wanted to be just like my mom, so I was constantly on her hip in the kitchen and trying to mimic her. Food is what brought us together, so if she liked something, I liked something.</p>
              <p>When I first started, I would think of [Julia] often. If the pasta would hit the wall, or if something didn’t look just right, I would think to myself, “Well, Julia would just keep going.” I just love that about her, that sense of “I’ve put my heart and my soul into this and it’s going to be whatever it’s going to be and we’re going to do this together, and you’re going to see all of it, no matter what.” It wasn’t about being perfect or the best; it was about living life to its fullest. She took something that was considered complicated, or precious, or for a very elite few, and made it digestible for people and fun. She’s just so groundbreaking. Would Emeril have had a band and been Emeril and said “BAM” and thrown a party every night? There’s a Galloping Gourmet running all over the room and joking and telling you every little bit of his personal life. I think that she’s the one that did that for everyone.</p>

              <p>Rich white people problems were never richer, whiter or more abundant than in the titular Yorkshire mansion of “Downton Abbey,” the sumptuous costume drama that premiered in 2011 to become the most watched series in the history of PBS’s “Masterpiece.” The entanglements of the aristocratic Crawley family and their below stairs staff flicked at earnest social commentary about the shifting mores of the early 20th century, but the plotlines were shamelessly popcorn: Mr. Bates and Anna’s many arrests; Lady Mary and Matthew’s doomed romance; Mrs. Patmore’s angst over the arrival of the electric mixer. Even in the aftermath of a global economic crisis — or perhaps because of it — audiences were keen for the diversion of an extravagant British period piece, especially one that offered a Kumbaya message (chamber music version) that people are not so different no matter their proximity to the stairs. </p>

In 1974, PBS debuted this British drama, set above and below stairs in the London home of the aristocratic Bellamy family. If less visually opulent than “Downton,” this show had greater scope and ambition, shifting time periods each season, eventually covering the years from 1903 to 1930. And the characters are, if anything, richer. When the final episode aired in the United States in 1977, Alistair Cooke, the host of “Masterpiece Theater,” said there should be a national day of mourning. In 2011, PBS and the BBC attempted to revive it, with a new upper crust family moving into 165 Bellamy Place, but <a href="https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/bbc-ends-production-on-upstairs-downstairs-revival/" target="_blank">the reboot only lasted two congenial</a> if not especially inspired seasons. </p>

              <p> Ken Burns’s 11-hour documentary series <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/movies/tv-view-our-war-the-way-it-was.html" target="_blank">“The Civil War,”</a> which aired on five consecutive nights in 1990, transformed American history into unexpected must-see TV. Not only did it smash PBS audience records, with close to 40 million people tuning in. It also turned the boyish, bowl-cut wearing filmmaker into perhaps the most influential historian in America. The signature aesthetic — mournful music, somber voice-over, slow pans across archival photographs — inspired plenty of parodies, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dFZIy-CjL8&list=PLBTUPfMwsvLWL_jyBKsbmtemFG9XYOGOL&index=82" target="_blank">“Ken Burns’s Ken Burns”</a> (in which the filmmaker played a trash-talking version of himself). The series has drawn plenty of <a href="http://historyextension.weebly.com/uploads/1/9/3/7/19374815/kenburnsfilmhsitory.pdf" target="_blank">criticism</a> for offering a romanticized narrative of the war as a tragic misunderstanding between brothers. But it still stands as a monument to a cultural moment when a sizable chunk of the American population was willing to sit down in shared contemplation of our history, rather than just fighting about it. </p>

              <p>“Finding Your Roots” is a kind of genealogical mystery show, wherein the Harvard intellectual Henry Louis Gates Jr. uncovers the ancestral lines of famous Americans. It’s also a platform for nudging white people to reckon with the legacy of slavery, with revealing results. In the show’s second season, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/watch/extras/anderson-coopers-civil-war-era-surprise" target="_blank">Gates informed the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper</a> that his fourth great-grandfather was murdered by a enslaved person who rebelled — “Your ancestor was beaten to death with a farm hoe,” was how he put it — to which Cooper replied, “He had 12 slaves, I don’t feel bad for him.” Cooper added: “It’s shameful and I feel such a sense of shame over it; at the same time, it’s the history of this country.” Later it was revealed that another second-season guest had a different approach for dealing with his own shame: Ben Affleck had convinced Gates to erase from the program any mention of a slave-owning ancestor. </p>

              <p>I was 11, maybe 12 when I started watching it, right around the time I got my first guitar. I would watch downstairs in our little living room on a box TV and record it on VCR. I didn’t have a guitar teacher, so I would sit there on this fuzzy, green carpet with my black Ibanez RX20 and watch what the guitar players were doing. Jimmie Vaughan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King, Buddy Guy. The tapes are warped in places because I would watch them over and over. </p>
              <p>I had never really seen live music before. A neighbor used to have parties where a mariachi band would play, and I saw Michael Jackson when I was 5 years old, but that was really it. Seeing blues on “A.C.L.,” just down the highway from where we lived outside of Austin, my eyes opened up. It gave me a greater appreciation of where I was from, and it showed me something outside of school — pep rallies and football games, that whole thing.</p>
              <p>One day, when I was about 21, I walked past [the executive producer] Terry Lickona in Austin. He said, “Hey, Gary! When are you going to play my show?” I was like, “Man, I’ve been waiting for you to ask me that question for a decade!” The first time I walked onstage [in 2007], I got emotional. There’s no feeling like it. The idea that there is this TV show where you can get a real, intimate, honest, raw performance — you just can’t really beat that. It captures a kind of energy exchange that makes you feel like you’re there. As a kid, I felt like I was there, and it changed my whole life.</p>

              <p>The boyish star tenor José Carreras was just 40 and at the pinnacle of his career when he was diagnosed with leukemia in the mid-1980s. But he beat the odds and survived. To welcome him back to performance, make money for his cancer foundation and celebrate the 1990 World Cup finals, his colleagues Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti sang an outdoor concert with him at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. The three tuxedoed Mediterranean gentlemen, belting arias, pop hits and Neapolitan songs at the top of their lungs while dripping with sweat, were an unlikely sensation, and the combo spent the ’90s doing over 30 of the shows. The easy-listening pablum was eaten up on PBS telecasts and as best-selling records, and became the defining operatic (or pseudo-operatic) phenomenon of the past 30 years. </p>

              <p> “Follow your bliss”: This piece of wisdom was familiar to students who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/10/nyregion/a-teacher-of-legends-becomes-one-himself.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank">flocked to the classes</a> of Joseph Campbell, a beloved literature professor at Sarah Lawrence College. “Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,” Bill Moyers’s six-part series, which aired in 1988, turned it into a (sometimes misunderstood)
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v_TB3Ii8Qc" target="_blank">cultural mantra</a>. “The Hero With a Thousand Faces,” Campbell’s 1949 study of comparative mythology, already had fans among the counterculture, including George Lucas, who has cited it as a foundational text for “Star Wars.” But the show made the professor, who died before the show aired, into a mainstream hero and Moyers, who had returned to PBS after a 10-year run at CBS, into television’s leading explorer of the Big Questions. </p>

              <p>In 1994, the talk show host Phil Donahue asked Bob Ross to “say out loud your work will never hang in a museum.” “Well, maybe it will,” Ross replied, though museums were not of course the point: On “The Joy of Painting” anyone could be an artist. The conceit was simple: Paint a picture in 26 minutes. The shows were taped in one sitting — a sunset, some clouds, a mighty mountain, and, in the last moment, a big pine. It made for mesmerizing television, then and now. The show ran for 11 seasons between 1983 and 1994, and in 2015 became a viral sensation on the streaming platform Twitch, where it met an entirely new audience, previously unfamiliar with the calming scrape of a palette knife or the comforts of Ross’s soothing voice. “There are no mistakes,” he assured viewers, “only happy accidents.” In March 2019, 24 years after his death, several of Ross’s paintings became part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.</p>

              <p>My folks split up in 1984. This meant every other weekend was spent at my dad’s apartment and approximately 20 hours of television before he delivered me back to my mom’s, glassy-eyed and buzzing with narrative. The old man loved sci-fi and horror, but the thing he loved most was a good whodunit, and that is how an 11-year old boy became infatuated with Miss Marple. Miss Marple was smart. Miss Marple was British. She was also funny (“they call it ‘dry’ over there” my dad would say), tenacious and did not suffer fools. But most of all, in an era where almost every hero curated for an adolescent boy vibrated with unapologetic masculinity, Miss Marple was a lady. Unmarried, unattached and uninterested in anything other than tripping liars up in mistruths and a nice cup of tea, Miss Marple had no job that I recall, just a way of showing up wherever a well-dressed corpse did. As PBS presented these adventures sans commercial interruption (aside from the occasional pledge drive, and yes, we had a tote bag for every poisoned cadaver), my father and I had no breaks to gather clues so we had to shout at the television in real time — “There’s blood on the gardening shears!” “There’s the missing cuff link!” Yet we were almost never ahead of Miss Marple, who was almost certainly ahead of her time. </p>

              <p> The longest-running news documentary series on television at more than 700 episodes and counting, “Frontline” raised the standard for tough, long-form investigative journalism when it was created, by the filmmaker and producer David Fanning, at WGBH in Boston in 1983. The program was a throwback even then, owing more to the ambitious, Cold War-era documentaries of “CBS Reports” than to the ascendant, faster-paced style of news coverage that had been inaugurated three years earlier by the arrival of CNN. Today, when mistrust of news is the norm, fueled by powerful forces in government and on cable, the show’s unflashy commitment to in-depth reporting, standards of proof and, above all, public service has never been less fashionable — or more essential.  </p>

              <p>Faster than a rolling “O” and stronger than a silent “E,” this mostly live-action children’s television show debuted in 1971 as the cool cat big sister to “Sesame Street.” “We’re going to turn it on,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdvHdY8oitA" target="_blank">the theme song began</a> — “it” meant literacy. The original cast included Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno and Bill Cosby, plus Irene Cara as part of the in-house kids band, the Short Circus. Mel Brooks showed up to voice “The Blond-Haired Cartoon Man.” Each of the 780 half-hour episodes, produced by the Children’s Television Workshop, taught kids phonics with blinding ’70s visuals and short sketches that deployed parody, satire, surrealism and doo-wop. Canceled in 1977, it was in the words of Freeman’s D.J. character, Mel Mounds, “Righteous, delighteous and out-of-sighteous.”</p>

              <p>Before we had hot yoga, trampoline yoga and goat yoga tutorials at our fingertips, there was Lilias. Lilias Folan wasn’t the first to popularize yoga. But she was perhaps the first to bring the exotic-seeming practice into middle-American living rooms, with her show “Lilias, Yoga and You,” which aired from 1970 to 1981. Time magazine once called her “the Julia Child of yoga.” A (male) journalist for The San Francisco Chronicle, writing in 1979, was a bit more effusive: “My yoga lady remains a mystery woman, a comely creature from a distant planet. She is demure and quite serious. By far her most intriguing aspect is that she never sweats.” A 2006 reboot, “Lilias! Yoga Gets Better With Age,” was shorter-lived. Her star may have faded, but for many, Lilias still flickers at the edge of childhood memory (and on YouTube), with her long dark braid and boldly colored unitards, leaning into a sun salutation. </p>

The show, whose purple star spread cheer and nonthreatening messages, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/arts/television/the-blame-for-barney-im-a-little-guilty.html" target="_blank">began life as a D.I.Y. video project created by a woman in Texas</a>. When the young daughter of a public television executive in Connecticut wouldn’t stop watching one of the videos, he smelled a preschool hit and acquired the rights. It was a golden instinct: “Barney” romped from 1992 to 2009 and spawned an avalanche of toys and other spinoffs. Parents, less tolerant of the cloying T.

              <p>“Antiques Roadshow,” the gentlest forebear of the reality TV boom, premiered in 1997 and never left. The premise of this BBC format is simple: People lay their bric-a-brac before appraisal specialists and discover whether these objects hold value beyond nostalgia. A mild tone of British restraint that survived the show’s American assimilation imbues each transaction. When a dusty basement bagatelle does render a hefty estimate (like the Diego Rivera painting valued near $1 million in a 2013 episode), the audience gets the thrill of the reveal, but the owners’ responses tend to the understated, typically ranging from speechlessness to “Gosh!” Never lingering on dashed hopes, “Antiques Roadshow” lacks the greedier edge of spawn like “Storage Wars” and “Pawn Stars.” Twenty-four seasons in, seen by up to eight million viewers a week, it has new relevance as the ultimate upcycler of the declutter age, where “stuff” isn’t shameful, but aspirational.</p>

              <p>One of my earliest memories of watching TV was “Sesame Street.” The way that show embraces imagination was very, very cool to me. Just the idea that all things are possible, and that when you have a combination of humans and Muppets and animation — all of the educational pieces of it — to me it was boundary-less. </p>
              <p>As the son of immigrant Americans it was one of the few, if not the only, inclusive pieces of television for a very long time. I think that probably played some role in feeling that the characters and the creativity were boundless. Just being able to see ourselves in children’s television in a way that lets you know that where your parents are from is OK, and your family structure is OK, and all of the things that you’re otherwise “othered” about in the world.</p>
              <p>“Sesame Street” makes you feel like you’re part of a wonderful group of friends. The humor is rarely based on making fun of anybody. I think as adults the easy joke is always to make fun of somebody and the thing that I love about humor — like the “Harold & Kumar” movies, even — is when the jokes are rarely, if ever, at the expense of somebody else. That’s not just a thing for kids, there’s that inner-“Sesame Street” that we should all remember.</p>

              <p>BILL-yunn. If there’s a word that sums up the science show “Cosmos,” it was that word, as spoken by the astronomer Carl Sagan. His way of pronouncing the word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZmafy_v8g8&feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">“billion” — and “million” and “trillion” and even “quadrillion,” for that matter</a> — were the equivalent of a science earworm. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyR9L8Yksq0" target="_blank">Johnny Carson spoofed it</a>, impersonating Sagan in a black wig and turtleneck. But the really big numbers underscored the vastness of what Sagan was talking about in this 13-part series from 1980: the universe. Everything. “The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be,” he told us. “We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” No one could have asked for a better guide.  </p>

              <p> As the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/que-pasa-usa/" target="_blank">first bilingual sitcom</a> to air in the U.S., this family comedy made history when it premiered in 1977. It ran for just 39 episodes, following three generations of the Peña family as the Cuban immigrants made a life for themselves in Miami’s Little Havana. But the show resonated with viewers who saw themselves in the Spanish-speaking abuela and abuelo, Adela and Antonio; the Lucy-and-Ricky-reminiscent parents, Juana and Pepe; and their Americanized, Spanglish-speaking children, Carmen and Joe. The comedy illuminated the Peñas’ struggles to embrace both their heritage and their new home, whether planning Carmen’s quinceñera or helping Adela and Antonio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9ZlKKyWjA&feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">study for their citizenship tests</a>. And its influence can be seen today in bilingual sitcoms like “Fresh Off the Boat,” “One Day at a Time” and “Bob Hearts Abishola,” which use television to illuminate the breadth of the American immigrant experience. </p>

              <p>With theaters shuttered, we are right back to where “Dance in America” started: bringing dance into living rooms. This Emmy Award-winning series, part of “Great Performances,” made its debut on PBS in 1976 and was remarkable from the start, producing programs that placed spotlights on the work of monumental choreographers like George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham and Twyla Tharp. (And capturing dancers without cutting off their feet!) If you had never really experienced live dance, but felt a strange craving to learn more, “Dance in America” — a training ground for future dancers, choreographers and audience members — hooked you in. Where else could you discover what a group of avant-garde rebels were up to? <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/05/19/fascinating-footsteps-beyond-the-mainstream/68475536-fc81-4d5c-9ceb-72a7bac3cebb/" target="_blank">“Beyond the Mainstream,”</a> a 1980 look at postmodern dance, remains one of its greatest treasures.  </p>

              <p>Studio kitchens were made to get around all the nuisance of working kitchens — the noise, the heat, the poor lighting, the awkward layouts — and to hold the audience’s attention with a star chef who told stories while they cooked. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxCQF0UjBH4" target="_blank">“Great Chefs” was the antithesis</a>, working around all those annoyances, shooting inside busy restaurants during off hours, with chefs who weren’t there to entertain so much as educate, and who rarely filled the space with jokes or chatter — some didn’t look at the camera at all.</p>
              <p>Production values were low on its run on PBS in the 1980s, and on reruns I watched throughout the late ’90s, but the food was absurdly elaborate, with an unflappable narrator floating in and out of the scene, explaining how to stuff truffle slices under chicken skin or french bone a chop. Often, there was no talking at all. On the screen, there were only hands, expertly pressing the edges of pastry, or whisking butter into puréed potatoes. It wasn’t glamorous, but as celebrity chefs in studio kitchens took over food television that was exactly the appeal of “Great Chefs”: a behind-the-scenes look at the work that went into every plate. </p>

Each episode featured a celebrity reader (including Eartha Kitt and Whoopi Goldberg); a related adventure led by the host, LeVar Burton; and a final review of the book from his young co-stars. The result was a series showered in Emmys, critical acclaim and the eternal love of parents who hated watching shows with squeaky cartoon voices. As host for

              <p> There’s a moment late in this eight-part series from the early ’80s on the development of Western modern art when the critic Robert Hughes picks up a pistol, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9--Zg1iUEc&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">aims at the bull’s-eye</a> — and the camera cuts to Jasper Johns’s painting “Target.” The upshot: The old expectations and meanings we assigned to images have come radically unstuck. In Paris or Philadelphia, looking at Bacon’s screaming popes or Rothko’s dusky abstractions, Hughes drew us into the modernist revolutions in art and architecture, and mapped them against changes in technology, commerce, colonialism (he calls Picasso’s breakthrough paintings of 1906-07 “essentially white art in blackface”), media and economics. So often TV presenters condescend to modern art, like it’s a shell game; Hughes, with nonchalant authority and an unmistakable accent we could call BBCified Australian, let viewers weigh up modernism for themselves. </p>

              <p>When Henry Hampton began work in 1976 on his landmark 14-hour documentary about the civil rights movement, the definitive histories of the subject had not yet been published. But that isn’t to say that America didn’t already have an image of it. Hampton intended it as a corrective to existing films, mostly by whites, that showed African-Americans as “brutalized primitives,” as he later put it. His version would show that “it was the strength of Blacks that made the civil rights movement happen.” The first part, covering the years 1954 to 1965, aired in 1987, winning wide acclaim. The second part, taking the story to 1985, followed five years later. Hampton, who had marched in Selma, Ala., followed a number of guiding principles, including no talking-head hindsight, sparing use of the period’s music (too overpowering) and lots of American flags, especially when held by Black children in archival footage. As he would say, “It’s our flag too.”  </p>

              <p>“Firing Line” is sometimes cited as the forerunner of today’s political talk shows. But unlike today’s partisan screamfests, Buckley ran his interruption-free hour like a civilized, if hardly gentle, debate club. Guests included politicians and policymakers, but also an eclectic range of cultural figures like Muhammad Ali, Germaine Greer, Jose Luis Borges, and Allen Ginsberg. Buckley, with his famously ornate vocabulary and eccentric upper-crusty vocal mannerisms, would have been an anomaly anywhere on television. But when the show moved to PBS in 1971 after five years of commercial syndication, he also became the rare conservative in what many on the right saw as enemy territory. “The challenge of conservatives in those years,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/18/arts/how-firing-line-transformed-the-battleground.html" target="_blank">once said</a>, “was not to convert others to our point of view, but to convince them that conservative views weren’t held by savages.”</p>

              <p> Before premium cable and streaming services demonstrated how even shows with simple premises could be elevated when lavished with talent and strong production values, “Inspector Morse” was helping redefine the television mystery — and PBS’s “Mystery!” It had strong casting, especially John Thaw as a charmingly irritable Oxford detective with a penchant for opera, crosswords and a pint or two. Its lovingly filmed shots of Oxford’s dreaming spires helped set the standard for the picturesque crime scenes of “Foyle’s War,” “Midsomer Murders” and “Shetland.” Now the torch has passed to a period prequel, “Endeavor,” where the young Morse of Shaun Evans slowly grows more Thaw-like (He’s got the Jaguar! He’s renovating the Morse home!) with each season. Now, as the 1960s of its first seasons give way to the ’70s, Morse fans can only hope that “Endeavor” will last into the ’80s, so the team can eventually remake all the originals. Infinite Morse!</p>

              <p> I lived in New York as a young actor. I was right in the middle of all of that culture. But I hardly had access to it. Far be it from me to be going to the opera and the ballet. I had limited resources. To be able to see these things on “Great Performances” was extraordinary.</p>
              <p>When I was told that <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2020/jun/15/great-performances-ann/" target="_blank">PBS wanted Ann</a> [Taylor’s one-woman show about the Texas governor Ann Richards] for “Great Performances,” I thought I literally could not be more honored. It felt like the absolute apogee, the absolute pinnacle.</p>
              <p>I can’t tell you quite what the effect is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np8dHna-OZg" target="_blank">hear that music and see the familiar logo</a> and have it be your play. It was really quite thrilling. The director was very mindful to make it as intimate as possible without ever making the audience feel that it was anything other than a theater production. It still felt like theater. It gave the viewer the sense of being an audience member who has the best seat heaven could provide. It had a magical intimacy.</p>
              <p>“Great Performances” is a real treasure. Nothing is like live theater, but that sure as hell comes close.</p>

              <p>“I died in Vietnam and didn’t even know it.” When PBS’s documentary series aired in 1983, enough time had passed for such vivid self-reflection, yet memories also remained lucid. An American Marine recalled mealtimes amid the smell of a battle in the city of Huế during the Tet Offensive: “It was almost like you were eating death.” There were 13 hour-long episodes and a 750-page book companion by the series’s chief correspondent, Stanley Karnow. The epic sweep of these projects captured public attention: Nearly 10 million tuned in a night, and the book, “Vietnam: A History,” stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for months. Yet in the documentary, American veterans said civilians had not acknowledged their sacrifices. The vet who said he’d unwittingly died in Vietnam, Paul Reutershan, was not exaggerating. Exposed to Agent Orange during the war, he died of cancer before the documentary aired.</p>

              <p>Biology lab meets “Alice in Wonderland,” “The Magic School Bus” ran for just four seasons but left a lasting imprint on the brains of ’90s kids.

But mostly it was a star vehicle for the science teacher Miss Frizzle, known as the Frizz (and voiced by Lily Tomlin), whose topical shirt-dresses and shock of curly red hair cut a feminine figure in contrast to the male TV nerds of “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and “Beakman’s World.” The bus is still running, in the form <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse" target="_blank">of a Netflix reboot</a> and a forthcoming film <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/elizabeth-banks-magic-school-bus-movie-ms-frizzle-1234689760/" target="_blank">starring Elizabeth Banks</a>.</p>

Rose had an assurance that viewers could understand all topics if the tone was right, and a knack for getting scientists or artists to expatiate from the most vapid questions. (Were they open-ended by design, or just the ad libs of a Southern gentleman who didn’t do the reading?) With TV talk now mostly receded to the safe spaces of cable news, “Charlie Rose” appears now almost like a lost horizon, a last gasp of highbrow generalism. </p>

              <p>“The French Chef” not only revolutionized cooking shows, it also made history on a more technical front when, in 1972, it became the first television show to feature open captioning — captions that are always onscreen — making it accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. The following year, as ABC began rebroadcasting its national news program on PBS just five hours after it originally aired, it became the first timely and accessible news program. As smaller tests of the closed captioning system (which allows viewers to toggle captions on or off) proved successful, PBS engineers worked to create caption editing consoles, encoding equipment and prototype decoder boxes. And on a Sunday evening in March 1980, closed captioning went mainstream. Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers got their chance to enjoy some of the most popular programming on television, getting to choose among “The ABC Sunday Night Movie,” “Disney’s Wonderful World” on NBC and “Masterpiece Theater.” </p>

              <p>Bill Nye was the science teacher every kid wanted: hyper, goofy and so darned smart. The show was, too: Nye made ideas come alive, and made his young viewers laugh while they learned. “The Science Guy” came to PBS in 1994 by way of Disney. Nye, who studied mechanical engineering at Cornell, raced through 100 episodes in a lab coat and a bow tie, and the show snatched up 19 Daytime Emmy Awards along the way. The science was real, and largely funded by the National Science Foundation. That investment appears to have paid off; when Nye speaks at college campuses these days to enthusiastic audiences, many of the students cheering for him are studying science and engineering, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/science/bill-nye-firebrand-for-science-is-a-big-man-on-campus.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank">and claim their early inspiration as that skinny guy in the bow tie</a>. </p>

As he explores alongside O the Owl (a tiny blue bird who exclaims “nifty galifty” whenever he learns something new), Katerina Kittycat (a friendly feline who loves ballet), Prince Wednesday (Daniel’s regal best friend) and Miss Elaina (a sort of homage to Mister Rogers’s Lady Elaine Fairchilde who calls everyone “toots”), the show, which began in 2012, reminds youngins that it’s always a beautiful day in the neighborhood. </p>

              <p>Beyond offering educational programming and handy tote bags, public television makes us feel like we’re a part of something bigger. Since 1989, any program that’s been funded by PBS is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/about/producing-pbs/proposal-process/guidelines/underwriting-4/" target="_blank">tagged with a message</a> about viewers like you. A decade later, “thank you” was tacked on to the end of it. It’s a familiar and comforting slogan that’s seeped into countless

A common thief!” After all, these programs wouldn’t be possible without contributions to your PBS stations without viewers like you. Thank you!</p>
