              <p>Death, war, divorce: None of these seem like auspicious subjects for a children’s television program. But for more than 30 years, beginning in 1968 on National Educational Television (the precursor to PBS), Fred Rogers covered all of these topics and more, with empathy and honesty. The soft-spoken, cardigan-wearing, former Presbyterian minister was concerned with not just the academic but the emotional education of children. As he told members of the Senate who were debating
              whether to defund public television in 1969, “I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service.” With the help of Daniel Tiger, King Friday XIII, Officer Clemmons and the rest of the residents of his neighborhood, Mr. Rogers taught viewers of all ages to not be afraid of their feelings, to always look for the helpers and to like themselves just the way they are. </p>

              <p>The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard called it “dissolution of TV in life, dissolution of life in TV”: “An American Family,” the 1973 documentary series revealing seven months in the home of Santa Barbara’s Loud family, presaged the coming of reality television by many years. In retrospect, the series is an appealingly loose portrait of mundane family life, captured before the tropes of reality TV calcified and the banal was repackaged as slickly sensational. But at the time it was controversial, dismissed by some as voyeuristic, fake-seeming or unfairly edited. The series represented a disruption both for television and the American family’s self-image: It chronicled Bill and Pat Loud’s divorce, and followed their eldest son, Lance, as he moved to New York and came out as gay. Lance became perhaps the first reality star, emerging from the show as a gay icon and epitomizing, as he put it himself, “the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are.” </p>

              <p> While now entrenched in the comedy pantheon, “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” was relatively unknown in America when it finished its run in England in 1974. Few, including its six members, thought its humor would translate. It was too highbrow, too weird, too British. That this was proved wrong by PBS, which is not known for anarchic humor, is an absurdity worthy of Python. Classic sketches about the Ministry of Silly Walks, dead parrots or the military’s weaponization of a joke so funny people die laughing became instant hits among public television audiences. When ABC aired edited episodes of the show, Monty Python sued, becoming the rare comedians to actually fight to stay off network television.</p>

              <p>When I was a kid my mom and I would watch PBS together, and Julia Child was just the most fascinating figure to me because she took herself — not seriously! At all. I just remember how funny and real she was — hitting the garlic and it would kick across the room and she’d just keep going, and she’d throw in fistfuls of salt, and she’d drink. My mom worked in restaurants for 60 years and I always wanted to be just like my mom, so I was constantly on her hip in the kitchen and trying to mimic her. Food is what brought us together, so if she liked something, I liked something.</p>
              <p>When I first started, I would think of [Julia] often. If the pasta would hit the wall, or if something didn’t look just right, I would think to myself, “Well, Julia would just keep going.” I just love that about her, that sense of “I’ve put my heart and my soul into this and it’s going to be whatever it’s going to be and we’re going to do this together, and you’re going to see all of it, no matter what.” It wasn’t about being perfect or the best; it was about living life to its fullest. She took something that was considered complicated, or precious, or for a very elite few, and made it digestible for people and fun. She’s just so groundbreaking. Would Emeril have had a band and been Emeril and said “BAM” and thrown a party every night? There’s a Galloping Gourmet running all over the room and joking and telling you every little bit of his personal life. I think that she’s the one that did that for everyone.</p>

              <p>Rich white people problems were never richer, whiter or more abundant than in the titular Yorkshire mansion of “Downton Abbey,” the sumptuous costume drama that premiered in 2011 to become the most watched series in the history of PBS’s “Masterpiece.” The entanglements of the aristocratic Crawley family and their below stairs staff flicked at earnest social commentary about the shifting mores of the early 20th century, but the plotlines were shamelessly popcorn: Mr. Bates and Anna’s many arrests; Lady Mary and Matthew’s doomed romance; Mrs. Patmore’s angst over the arrival of the electric mixer. Even in the aftermath of a global economic crisis — or perhaps because of it — audiences were keen for the diversion of an extravagant British period piece, especially one that offered a Kumbaya message (chamber music version) that people are not so different no matter their proximity to the stairs. </p>

              <p>Decades before “Downton Abbey,” other feet climbed the servants’ stairs of an elegant manse. In 1974, PBS debuted this British drama, set above and below stairs in the London home of the aristocratic Bellamy family. If less visually opulent than “Downton,” this show had greater scope and ambition, shifting time periods each season, eventually covering the years from 1903 to 1930. And the characters are, if anything, richer. When the final episode aired in the United States in 1977, Alistair Cooke, the host of “Masterpiece Theater,” said there should be a national day of mourning. In 2011, PBS and the BBC attempted to revive it, with a new upper crust family moving into 165 Bellamy Place, but the reboot only lasted two congenial if not especially inspired seasons. </p>

              <p> Ken Burns’s 11-hour documentary series “The Civil War,” which aired on five consecutive nights in 1990, transformed American history into unexpected must-see TV. Not only did it smash PBS audience records, with close to 40 million people tuning in. It also turned the boyish, bowl-cut wearing filmmaker into perhaps the most influential historian in America. The signature aesthetic — mournful music, somber voice-over, slow pans across archival photographs — inspired plenty of parodies, including “Ken Burns’s Ken Burns” (in which the filmmaker played a trash-talking version of himself). The series has drawn plenty of criticism for offering a romanticized narrative of the war as a tragic misunderstanding between brothers. But it still stands as a monument to a cultural moment when a sizable chunk of the American population was willing to sit down in shared contemplation of our history, rather than just fighting about it. </p>

              <p>“Finding Your Roots” is a kind of genealogical mystery show, wherein the Harvard intellectual Henry Louis Gates Jr. uncovers the ancestral lines of famous Americans. It’s also a platform for nudging white people to reckon with the legacy of slavery, with revealing results. In the show’s second season, Gates informed the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that his fourth great-grandfather was murdered by a enslaved person who rebelled — “Your ancestor was beaten to death with a farm hoe,” was how he put it — to which Cooper replied, “He had 12 slaves, I don’t feel bad for him.” Cooper added: “It’s shameful and I feel such a sense of shame over it; at the same time, it’s the history of this country.” Later it was revealed that another second-season guest had a different approach for dealing with his own shame: Ben Affleck had convinced Gates to erase from the program any mention of a slave-owning ancestor. </p>

              <p>I was 11, maybe 12 when I started watching it, right around the time I got my first guitar. I would watch downstairs in our little living room on a box TV and record it on VCR. I didn’t have a guitar teacher, so I would sit there on this fuzzy, green carpet with my black Ibanez RX20 and watch what the guitar players were doing. Jimmie Vaughan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King, Buddy Guy. The tapes are warped in places because I would watch them over and over. </p>
              <p>I had never really seen live music before. A neighbor used to have parties where a mariachi band would play, and I saw Michael Jackson when I was 5 years old, but that was really it. Seeing blues on “A.C.L.,” just down the highway from where we lived outside of Austin, my eyes opened up. It gave me a greater appreciation of where I was from, and it showed me something outside of school — pep rallies and football games, that whole thing.</p>
              <p>One day, when I was about 21, I walked past [the executive producer] Terry Lickona in Austin. He said, “Hey, Gary! When are you going to play my show?” I was like, “Man, I’ve been waiting for you to ask me that question for a decade!” The first time I walked onstage [in 2007], I got emotional. There’s no feeling like it. The idea that there is this TV show where you can get a real, intimate, honest, raw performance — you just can’t really beat that. It captures a kind of energy exchange that makes you feel like you’re there. As a kid, I felt like I was there, and it changed my whole life.</p>

              <p>The boyish star tenor José Carreras was just 40 and at the pinnacle of his career when he was diagnosed with leukemia in the mid-1980s. But he beat the odds and survived. To welcome him back to performance, make money for his cancer foundation and celebrate the 1990 World Cup finals, his colleagues Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti sang an outdoor concert with him at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. The three tuxedoed Mediterranean gentlemen, belting arias, pop hits and Neapolitan songs at the top of their lungs while dripping with sweat, were an unlikely sensation, and the combo spent the ’90s doing over 30 of the shows. The easy-listening pablum was eaten up on PBS telecasts and as best-selling records, and became the defining operatic (or pseudo-operatic) phenomenon of the past 30 years. </p>

              <p> “Follow your bliss”: This piece of wisdom was familiar to students who flocked to the classes of Joseph Campbell, a beloved literature professor at Sarah Lawrence College. “Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,” Bill Moyers’s six-part series, which aired in 1988, turned it into a (sometimes misunderstood) cultural mantra. “The Hero With a Thousand Faces,” Campbell’s 1949 study of comparative mythology, already had fans among the counterculture, including George Lucas, who has cited it as a foundational text for “Star Wars.” But the show made the professor, who died before the show aired, into a mainstream hero and Moyers, who had returned to PBS after a 10-year run at CBS, into television’s leading explorer of the Big Questions. </p>

              <p>In 1994, the talk show host Phil Donahue asked Bob Ross to “say out loud your work will never hang in a museum.” “Well, maybe it will,” Ross replied, though museums were not of course the point: On “The Joy of Painting” anyone could be an artist. The conceit was simple: Paint a picture in 26 minutes. The shows were taped in one sitting — a sunset, some clouds, a mighty mountain, and, in the last moment, a big pine. It made for mesmerizing television, then and now. The show ran for 11 seasons between 1983 and 1994, and in 2015 became a viral sensation on the streaming platform Twitch, where it met an entirely new audience, previously unfamiliar with the calming scrape of a palette knife or the comforts of Ross’s soothing voice. “There are no mistakes,” he assured viewers, “only happy accidents.” In March 2019, 24 years after his death, several of Ross’s paintings became part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.</p>

              <p>My folks split up in 1984. This meant every other weekend was spent at my dad’s apartment and approximately 20 hours of television before he delivered me back to my mom’s, glassy-eyed and buzzing with narrative. The old man loved sci-fi and horror, but the thing he loved most was a good whodunit, and that is how an 11-year old boy became infatuated with Miss Marple. Miss Marple was smart. Miss Marple was British. She was also funny (“they call it ‘dry’ over there” my dad would say), tenacious and did not suffer fools. But most of all, in an era where almost every hero curated for an adolescent boy vibrated with unapologetic masculinity, Miss Marple was a lady. Unmarried, unattached and uninterested in anything other than tripping liars up in mistruths and a nice cup of tea, Miss Marple had no job that I recall, just a way of showing up wherever a well-dressed corpse did. As PBS presented these adventures sans commercial interruption (aside from the occasional pledge drive, and yes, we had a tote bag for every poisoned cadaver), my father and I had no breaks to gather clues so we had to shout at the television in real time — “There’s blood on the gardening shears!” “There’s the missing cuff link!” Yet we were almost never ahead of Miss Marple, who was almost certainly ahead of her time. </p>

              <p>A New York Times article in 1991, carrying the headline “TV Film About Gay Black Men Is Under Attack,” described “Tongues Untied” as “an experimental amalgam of rap music, street poetry, documentary film and dance.” Most coverage of the film focused not on the work itself, but on straight, white people’s reactions to it: the refusal of certain public television stations to air it, Pat Buchanan’s presidential ad campaign that likened the work to “pornography,” the congressional hearings with the aim of ensuring that The National Endowment for the Arts — from whom the filmmaker received a $5,000 grant to help fund the film — would never be used to fund works like this again. Missing were any perspectives from voices that should’ve mattered: Young gay Black boys like myself, in awe of seeing themselves represented on TV, with honesty and dignity, for the first time. </p>

              <p> The longest-running news documentary series on television at more than 700 episodes and counting, “Frontline” raised the standard for tough, long-form investigative journalism when it was created, by the filmmaker and producer David Fanning, at WGBH in Boston in 1983. The program was a throwback even then, owing more to the ambitious, Cold War-era documentaries of “CBS Reports” than to the ascendant, faster-paced style of news coverage that had been inaugurated three years earlier by the arrival of CNN. Today, when mistrust of news is the norm, fueled by powerful forces in government and on cable, the show’s unflashy commitment to in-depth reporting, standards of proof and, above all, public service has never been less fashionable — or more essential.  </p>

              <p>Faster than a rolling “O” and stronger than a silent “E,” this mostly live-action children’s television show debuted in 1971 as the cool cat big sister to “Sesame Street.” “We’re going to turn it on,” the theme song began — “it” meant literacy. The original cast included Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno and Bill Cosby, plus Irene Cara as part of the in-house kids band, the Short Circus. Mel Brooks showed up to voice “The Blond-Haired Cartoon Man.” Each of the 780 half-hour episodes, produced by the Children’s Television Workshop, taught kids phonics with blinding ’70s visuals and short sketches that deployed parody, satire, surrealism and doo-wop. Canceled in 1977, it was in the words of Freeman’s D.J. character, Mel Mounds, “Righteous, delighteous and out-of-sighteous.”</p>

              <p>Before we had hot yoga, trampoline yoga and goat yoga tutorials at our fingertips, there was Lilias. Lilias Folan wasn’t the first to popularize yoga. But she was perhaps the first to bring the exotic-seeming practice into middle-American living rooms, with her show “Lilias, Yoga and You,” which aired from 1970 to 1981. Time magazine once called her “the Julia Child of yoga.” A (male) journalist for The San Francisco Chronicle, writing in 1979, was a bit more effusive: “My yoga lady remains a mystery woman, a comely creature from a distant planet. She is demure and quite serious. By far her most intriguing aspect is that she never sweats.” A 2006 reboot, “Lilias! Yoga Gets Better With Age,” was shorter-lived. Her star may have faded, but for many, Lilias still flickers at the edge of childhood memory (and on YouTube), with her long dark braid and boldly colored unitards, leaning into a sun salutation. </p>

              <p>Their kids may have their own kids by now, but parents of a certain era still have “Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination,” the opening line of the “Barney and Friends” theme song, stuck in their heads. The show, whose purple star spread cheer and nonthreatening messages, began life as a D.I.Y. video project created by a woman in Texas. When the young daughter of a public television executive in Connecticut wouldn’t stop watching one of the videos, he smelled a preschool hit and acquired the rights. It was a golden instinct: “Barney” romped from 1992 to 2009 and spawned an avalanche of toys and other spinoffs. Parents, less tolerant of the cloying T. Rex than their offspring, no doubt stocked up on earplugs.  </p>

              <p> This sticky-fingered filcher first emerged in a 1985 video game of the same name but was brought to life thanks to the game show that took kids around the world — and, later, through history. With her signature red trench coat and fedora, Carmen Sandiego led viewers on wild goose chases from Nashville to Norway while also working to remedy what the show’s creators saw as an alarming statistic: According to a National Geographic survey in 1991, the year the series debuted, one in four Americans could not locate the Pacific Ocean. The superthief is still pilfering away today, in a Netflix animated series and on Google Earth.   </p>

              <p>“Antiques Roadshow,” the gentlest forebear of the reality TV boom, premiered in 1997 and never left. The premise of this BBC format is simple: People lay their bric-a-brac before appraisal specialists and discover whether these objects hold value beyond nostalgia. A mild tone of British restraint that survived the show’s American assimilation imbues each transaction. When a dusty basement bagatelle does render a hefty estimate (like the Diego Rivera painting valued near $1 million in a 2013 episode), the audience gets the thrill of the reveal, but the owners’ responses tend to the understated, typically ranging from speechlessness to “Gosh!” Never lingering on dashed hopes, “Antiques Roadshow” lacks the greedier edge of spawn like “Storage Wars” and “Pawn Stars.” Twenty-four seasons in, seen by up to eight million viewers a week, it has new relevance as the ultimate upcycler of the declutter age, where “stuff” isn’t shameful, but aspirational.</p>
